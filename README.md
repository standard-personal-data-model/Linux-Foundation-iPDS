# Linux-Fdn-iPDS
Linux Foundation [Integrated Personal Data Store (iPDS)](https://github.com/integrated-personal-data-system) is currently using an early draft version of the IEEE Person Ontology in its testbed and plans to be an environment for test and demonstration, plus possible implementation if a User Group of early adopters can be recruited.  
A video of a live demo of iPDS is at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c95ESkIL5N5ASNZGza5TOg3okkfHBnUB/view?usp=sharing .
